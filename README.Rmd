<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of juicedown is to offer useful tools to minimize routine formatting of 
page contents on such CMS/LMS as Moodle where code editor silently ignore style 
and link tags. To generate CSS-inlined HTML, the package uses 
[juicyjuce](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=juicyjuice) package 
along with [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr) and [markdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=markdown) packages. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of juicedown from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kenjisato/juicedown")
```

## Example

Main function is `convert()`. (Usually, you do not need `dir` argument)

```{r example}
library(juicedown)
convert(juicedown_example("markdown", "sample.md"), dir = ".", clip = FALSE)

# See the result
# browseURL("sample.html")
```


List sample file directories with

```{r list-samples}
juicedown_example()
```

List contents in the sample with 

```{r list-contents}
juicedown_example("javascript")
```

```{r see-inside, eval = FALSE}
file.show(juicedown_example("javascript", "sample.Rmd"))
```
